                          The Company will provide you with an accounting of
                          disclosures by The Company of your health information
                          during the six years prior to the date of your

                          certain disclosures, such as those made: 1) to carry
                          out treatment, payment or health care operations; 2)
                          directly to you or your personal representatives; or

                          Company will charge a reasonable, cost-based fee for
                          each subsequent accounting. Requests for a request of
                          an accounting of disclosures should be made in writing

                          of your health information. To request a general
                          restriction, you must identify in this request: (i)
                          what particular information you would like to limit,
                          (ii) whether you want to limit use, disclosure, or
                          both, and (iii) to whom you want the limits to apply.
                          We will consider your request but are not required to
                          agree. We have the right to terminate the restriction
                          if: (i) you agree orally or in writing to terminate
                          the restriction, or (ii) if we inform you of the
                          termination, which becomes effective only for your
                          health information created or received after we inform

                          Request a plan restriction. A plan restriction is one
                          that meets the following three conditions: (a) it is
                          to restrict disclosure of your health information to a
                          health plan for purposes of payment or health care
                          operations; (b) the health information relates solely
                          to a health care item or service for which you, or
                          someone on your behalf, has paid us in full; and (c)
                          the disclosure is not otherwise required by law. If
                          you wish to request a plan restriction, you must do so
                          separately for each service visit, and must make your
                          request to The Company before your visit. Otherwise
                          The Company will automatically submit the claim to
                          your health plan on record, if any, for payment. We
                          will not agree to a plan restriction unless we have
                          first received payment in full for the item or
                          service. We will also not agree to a plan restriction
                          if by law we are required to submit your health
                          information to the plan. If we do agree to a
                          restriction, we will not apply the restriction in the
                          event of an emergency.

                          arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be

                          documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will
                          make a decision in writing, but need not provide a
                          statement of reasons unless requested by either Party.
                          The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any
                          award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do

                          AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take

                          The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not
                          subject to the above provisions concerning informal
                          negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes
                          seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
                          validity of, any of the intellectual property rights
                          of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising
                          from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of
                          privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for
                          injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
                          illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will
                          elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that
                          portion of this provision found to be illegal or
                          unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a
                          court of competent jurisdiction within the courts
                          listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree
                          to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

                          medical matters should be reported immediately to your
                          provider's office by phone, or by going to an
                          emergency room, or dialing 911.  Response times to
                          messages vary by location and provider and not all
